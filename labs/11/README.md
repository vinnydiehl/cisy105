## 3. Property Tax

A county collects property taxes on the assessment value of property, which is
60% of the property's actual value. If an acre of land is valued at $10,000,
its assessment value is $6,000. The property tax is then $0.64 for each $100 of
the assessment value. The tax for the acre assessed at $6,000 will be $38.40.
Create a GUI application that displays the assessment value and property tax
when a user enters the actual value of a property.
