## 4. Software Sales

A software company sells a package that retails for $99. Quantity discounts are
given according to the following table:

| Quantity | Discount |
| -------: | :------: |
|    10-19 |    20%   |
|    20-49 |    30%   |
|    50-99 |    40%   |
|     100+ |    50%   |

Design a class that stores the number of units sold and has a method that
returns the total cost of the purchase.

## 5. `BankCharges` Class

A bank charges $10 per month plus the following check fees for a commercial
checking account:

 * $.10 for each check if less than 20 checks were written
 * $.08 for each check if 20 through 39 checks were written
 * $.06 for each check if 40 through 59 checks were written
 * $.04 for each check if 60 or more checks were written

The bank also charges an extra $15 if the account balance falls below $400
(before any check fees are applied). Design a class that stores the ending
balance of an account and the number of checks written. It should also have a
method that returns the bank's service fees for the month.
