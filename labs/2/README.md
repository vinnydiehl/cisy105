## 14. Stock Commission

Kathryn bought 1000 shares of stock at a price of $25.50 per share. She must
pay her stock broker a 2 percent commission for the transaction. Write a
program that calculates and displays the following:

 * The amount paid for the stock alone (without the commission)
 * The amount of the commission
 * The total amount paid (for the stock plus the commission)

## 16. Energy Drink Consumption

A soft drink company recently surveyed 15,000 of its customers and found that
approximately 18 percent of those surveyed purchase one or more energy drinks
per week. Of those customers who purchase energy drinks, approximately 58
percent of them prefer citrus-flavored energy drinks. Write a program that
displays the following:

 * The approximate number of customers in the survey who purchase one or more
   energy drinks per week
 * The approximate number of customers in the survey who prefer
   citrus-flavored energy drinks

## 18. Stock Transaction Program

Last month Joe purchased some stock in Acme Software, Inc. Here are the
details of the purchase:

 * The number of shares that Joe purchased was 1,000.
 * When Joe purchased the stock, he paid $32.87 per share.
 * Joe paid his stockbroker a commission that amounted to 2% of the amount
   that he paid for the stock.

Two weeks later Joe sold the stock. Here are the details of the sale:

 * The number of shares that Joe sold was 1,000.
 * He sold the stock for $33.92 per share.
 * He paid his stockbroker another commission that amounted to 2% of the
   amount he received for the stock.

Write a program that displays the following information:

 * The amount of money Joe paid for the stock.
 * The amount of commission Joe paid his stock broker when he bought the
   stock.
 * The amount that Joe sold the stock for.
 * The amount of commission Joe paid his broker when he sold the stock.
 * Display the amount of profit that Joe made after selling his stock and
   paying the two commissions to his broker. (If the amount of profit that
   your program displays is a negative number, then Joe lost money on the
   transaction.)
