## 8. Sum of Numbers

Write a method that accepts an integer argument and returns the sum of all the
integers from 1 up to the number passed as an argument. For example, if 50 is
passed as an argument, the method will return the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, ... 50.
Use recursion to calculate the sum. Demonstrate the method in a program.

## Output

An example output is as follows:

    [vinny@gentoo 14]$ make -s run
    Number: 5
    Sum: 15
    [vinny@gentoo 14]$ make -s run
    Number: 17
    Sum: 153
    [vinny@gentoo 14]$ make -s run
    Number: 134
    Sum: 9045
